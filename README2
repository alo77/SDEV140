  Organized into functions and classes for easy maintenance and scalability.

- **Consistent Clear Navigation:**  
  Clear labels, buttons, and a consistent layout ensure users can easily navigate the application.

- **Images with Alternate Text:**  
  Includes at least two images:
  - `images/main_menu.png` ‚Äì *Alternate text: "Main menu interface"*

- **Validation Testing:**  
  Comprehensive testing has been performed:
  - **Test Data:**  
    - **Empty Input:** Checks that an error message is displayed.
    - **Correct Answer:** Verifies that the score increments.
    - **Incorrect Answer:** Confirms that no score change occurs and feedback is provided.
  - **Test Results:**  
    - All tests passed after refining input validation and error handling.
  - **Screenshots:**  
    - Placeholders are provided below for successful test case demonstrations.
